# chromium-on-pi

A tutorial on how to launch chromium and kubernetes on raspberry pis

## TODO

This is in progres, but for now it combines: https://blog.hypriot.com/post/setup-kubernetes-raspberry-pi-cluster/
with some kubernetes manifets to setup X (as a server) on the host and then run chromium with access to that X server.

See https://github.com/jaredallard/docker-parsec for a sum-up of how this is possible.

### WHY?

 * easy to sync state of "kiosk" machines
 * docker is fun
